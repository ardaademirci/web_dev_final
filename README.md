Everything about the final project is in the 'master' branch of this repository.

The difficulties I encountered were, actualy almost every part of it. Because I was initially not interested in web developement, I was clueless about it until this course.

I chose this so that I wouldn't be graduating without knowing nothing about web developement.

I hoped web developement would be easy and simple. Maybe it actualy is but definetaly that is not the case for me.

For me it was complex and sooo intertwined with a lot of other components, I couldn't wrap my head around it.

Trying to learn these things from scratch while working on my Senior Final Project was challenging for me.

---- BUT NONE OF THESE ARE EXCUSES. ----

In fact I have no excuses for my work, because there are other students who are in the same situations as me that succeeds in this course.

The only reason I explained all of this is, so that you wouldn't take incompleteness of my work as a disrespect towards yourself.

Again, these are not meant to be excuses. I wish I could delivered more decent work.
